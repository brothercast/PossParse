# SSPEC Possibility Parser Flask Web App  
![SSPEC PossParse] (static/images/sspec_default.png)  
SSPEC PossParse is an innovative web application designed to facilitate mass collaboration across various divides. By leveraging the power of structured speculation and the latest AI language models, it provides a platform for users to generate and select goals, create structured outcomes, and engage with conditional elements of satisfaction (COS).  
  
## Purpose  
  
The primary purpose of SSPEC PossParse is to democratize the process of problem-solving and innovation. It aims to break down barriers between different groups and individuals, encouraging a collective approach to creating solutions for complex challenges.  
  
## Goal  
  
SSPEC PossParse's goal is to enable users to:  
  
- Input their ideas or challenges.  
- Receive speculated high-level outcomes based on their input.  
- Select the most aligned goal with their vision.  
- Generate a structured solution with phases and conditional elements.  
- Collaborate on conditions of satisfaction to refine and implement solutions.  
  
## Usage  
  
### Setting Up the Environment  
  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```shell  
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sspec-posspars.git  
   cd sspec-posspars  
 
2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```shell 
    pip install -r requirements.txt  
 
3. Set up environment variables by creating a .env file with the following content (make sure to replace placeholders with your actual API keys):

    ```shell 
    AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY='your_azure_openai_api_key'  
    AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT='your_azure_openai_endpoint'  
    AZURE_DEPLOYMENT_NAME='your_azure_deployment_name'  
    STABILITY_KEY='your_stability_sdk_api_key'  
 
4. Initialize the database:

    ```shell 
    flask db upgrade  
 
5. Start the application:
    ```shell 
    flask run  
 

# Using the App

- Home Page: Navigate to the home page (/) to start your journey. Input your idea or challenge in the provided text box.
- Goal Selection: After submitting your input, you will be redirected to the goal selection page (/goal_selection). Choose the goal that best represents your desired outcome.
- Outcome Generation: Once a goal is selected, the application generates a structured solution, including phases and conditional elements (/outcome).
- Collaboration: Users can add, edit, or delete conditional elements of satisfaction to refine the structured solution. Each COS can be analyzed for further insights.
- Visualization: The app offers visual representations of the goals and outcomes, aiding in the collaborative process.
